# The Daem0n's Protocol

## Overview

When Daem0nMCP memory tools are available, you MUST follow this protocol. Memory without discipline is noise.

**Core principle:** Check before you change, record what you decide, track whether it worked.

## Tool Detection

First, verify Daem0nMCP tools are available:

```
Look for these tools in your available tools:
- mcp__daem0nmcp__get_briefing
- mcp__daem0nmcp__context_check
- mcp__daem0nmcp__remember
- mcp__daem0nmcp__record_outcome
```

**If tools are NOT available:** This skill does not apply. Proceed normally.

**If tools ARE available:** Follow the protocol below. No exceptions.

## The Protocol

### 1. SESSION START (Non-Negotiable)

```
IMMEDIATELY when you have daem0nmcp tools:

mcp__daem0nmcp__get_briefing()

DO NOT:
- Ask user what they want first
- Skip briefing because "it's a quick task"
- Assume you remember from last session
```

The briefing loads:
- Past decisions and their outcomes
- Warnings and failed approaches to AVOID
- Patterns to FOLLOW
- Git changes since last session

### 2. BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES

```
BEFORE touching any file:

mcp__daem0nmcp__context_check(description="what you're about to do")

OR for specific files:

mcp__daem0nmcp__recall_for_file(file_path="path/to/file")
```

**If context_check returns:**
- **WARNING:** You MUST acknowledge it to the user
- **FAILED APPROACH:** Explain how your approach differs
- **must_not:** These are HARD CONSTRAINTS - do not violate

### 3. AFTER MAKING DECISIONS

```
AFTER every significant decision:

memory_result = mcp__daem0nmcp__remember(
    category="decision",  # or "pattern", "warning", "learning"
    content="What you decided",
    rationale="Why you decided it",
    file_path="relevant/file.py",  # optional
    tags=["relevant", "tags"]
)

SAVE THE MEMORY ID - you need it for record_outcome
```

**Category Guide:**
| Category | Use For | Persistence |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| decision | Architectural/design choices | Decays over 30 days |
| pattern | Recurring approaches to follow | PERMANENT |
| warning | Things to avoid | PERMANENT |
| learning | Lessons from experience | Decays over 30 days |

### 4. AFTER IMPLEMENTATION (Critical)

```
AFTER implementing and testing:

mcp__daem0nmcp__record_outcome(
    memory_id=<id from remember>,
    outcome="What actually happened",
    worked=true  # or false
)
```

**FAILURES ARE VALUABLE.** If something doesn't work:
- Record `worked=false` with explanation
- Failed approaches get 1.5x boost in future searches
- You WILL see past mistakes - that's the point

## Red Flags - STOP

- About to edit a file without calling `recall_for_file`
- Making a significant decision without calling `remember`
- Implementation complete but no `record_outcome` called
- Context check returned WARNING but you didn't acknowledge it
- Repeating an approach that previously failed

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "It's a small change" | Small changes compound into big problems |
| "I'll remember later" | You won't. Record now. |
| "Context check is overkill" | 5 seconds now vs hours debugging later |
| "The warning doesn't apply" | Warnings exist because someone failed before |
| "I don't need to record failures" | Failures are the most valuable memories |

## Workflow Summary

```
SESSION START
    └─> get_briefing()

BEFORE CHANGES
    └─> context_check("what you're doing")
    └─> recall_for_file("path") for specific files
    └─> ACKNOWLEDGE any warnings

AFTER DECISIONS
    └─> remember(category, content, rationale)
    └─> SAVE the memory_id

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
    └─> record_outcome(memory_id, outcome, worked)
```

## Why This Matters

Without protocol discipline:
- You repeat past mistakes
- Decisions get lost between sessions
- Patterns aren't captured
- Failures aren't learned from
- The memory system becomes useless noise

With protocol discipline:
- Past mistakes surface before you repeat them
- Decisions persist across sessions
- Patterns compound into project knowledge
- Failures become learning opportunities
- The AI actually gets smarter over time

## The Bottom Line

**Memory tools exist. Use them correctly.**

Check context. Record decisions. Track outcomes.

This is non-negotiable when Daem0nMCP tools are available.
